"""Regression tests for ReDoS in the regexes that parse untrusted LLM output.

CodeQL flagged several `py/polynomial-redos` sinks in `text_helpers.py` and
`tool_parsing.py`. Each is a delimiter-bounded pattern (`<open>...<close>`)
applied with `re.sub`/`re.finditer` over a whole model response. When the
closing delimiter is missing, the engine rescans to end-of-string from every
opening occurrence -> O(n^2) on attacker-influenced input (prompt injection
via tool output / retrieved content).

These tests pin BOTH halves of the fix:
  * correctness is unchanged for legitimate inputs, and
  * pathological "many openers, no closer" inputs complete promptly.

The timing bound is deliberately loose (seconds, not ms) so it never flakes on
a slow CI box; the unguarded code took tens of seconds on the same inputs, so
the margin is ~100x.
